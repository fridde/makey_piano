# makey_piano

This is a very simple standalone html-js-piano that is build with the [MakeyMakey](http://makeymakey.com/) in mind.

## Usage
Simply download the zip, extract to a directory of your choice and open ```makey_keyboard.html``` in a webbrowser (tested with Chrome).

## Configuration
If you want to change the soundfiles, simply copy some of your own mp3-files into the folder ```mp3``` and rename them into ```up```,```down``` etc.
Don't forget to reload the page after the reconfiguration.
